# Welcome!

The [Capacitor Community GitHub org](https://github.com/capacitor-community) seeks to bring together the highest quality Capacitor plugins and the Capacitor plugin authoring community into a single place and help users find high quality, well maintained Capacitor plugins.

Each plugin in this org commits to a base level of maintenance and quality control, and, as much as possible, follows a set of consistent design and code standards.

Unlike [Capacitor](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor) itself (iOS/Android/Web platforms, official plugins, and tooling), the Capacitor Community plugins are not primarily maintained by the Capacitor core team but by the community and community maintainers. The Capacitor team does, however, facilitate and work closely with maintainers to ensure that plugins are kept up to date, follow the latest in Capacitor plugin standards, and have a broad set of useful functionality.

Beyond maintenance, plugin authors commit to providing a safe environment and adhere to the community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/capacitor-community/welcome/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and expect the same of all users.

## Plugins

To find plugins offered by the Capacitor Community:

1. Search the [repos](https://github.com/capacitor-community).
1. Search the [active plugin proposals](https://github.com/capacitor-community/proposals/issues).
1. Still not found? [Propose a new plugin!](https://github.com/capacitor-community/proposals) :sparkling_heart:

### Create a New Plugin

1. [**Create a proposal**](https://github.com/capacitor-community/proposals). Proposals are useful at any stage of development (idea to fully implemented) to gather feedback from other plugin authors. Before a plugin can be added to the Capacitor Community, the proposal must be accepted.
1. [**Join the Capacitor Contributor Slack**](https://getcapacitor.herokuapp.com/). You may be asked to join a Slack workspace to coordinate transfer or setup of your plugin repo.
1. [**Follow the new plugin instructions**](https://github.com/capacitor-community/welcome/blob/main/NEW_PLUGIN_INSTRUCTIONS.md). To foster a community where contributions are as quick and easy as possible, plugins should follow a set of conventions and use consistent tooling, code style, structure, documentation, etc.
